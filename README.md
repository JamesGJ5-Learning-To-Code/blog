API for a blog, made at the behest of The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-blog-api) to learn to learn to build a CRUD API.

The code isn't very clean but this learning project incorporates Express.js, a MongoDB database (accessed using the Mongoose ODM), API authentication (using Passport.js and JSON Web Tokens) and more.
